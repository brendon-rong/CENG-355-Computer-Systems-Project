The “Covid Security System” (CSS) is a piece of hardware that was specifically designed
to help businesses maintain the safety of their employees as well as customers. The “Covid
Security System” was designed to help take the load off and get businesses back up and running
as if nothing has changed. The system utilizes a specific set of hand-picked sensors that work in
sync with each other and has a mobile app that keeps track of all the employees' temperatures.
